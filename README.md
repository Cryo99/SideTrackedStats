# SideTrackedStats
A userscript that shows SideTracked cache stats on geocaching.com. It adds the SideTracked banner in the following places:

* the Stats Bar area of your profile page;
* your public profile, if it doesn't already exist there;
* SideTracked cache pages.

On cache pages it adds the C. O.'s banner as well.

__Please note:__ in order for the banner to be added to your public profile, you need to have some content in the "Bio" area. If this area is empty,
the necessary container is not generated by the site. An empty HTML comment (<!-- -->) is sufficient and prevents the need for unwanted output in your
profile. This is also true for James' Church Micro Stats. This may be fixed in a later version.

This script was inspired by, and is based on, James Inge's [Church Micro Stats](https://openuserjs.org/scripts/JRI/Church_Micro_Stats) and works in
concert with it, as you can see from the screen shots. Thanks and credit should go to James for his efforts.
